WASHINGTON, D.C. – In the latest twist to the Trump administration’s approach to international trade, sources inside the White House have confirmed that former President Donald Trump has adopted a new decision-making tool for economic policy: a daisy.

According to staff, Trump was spotted earlier this week wandering into the White House Rose Garden, holding a single flower and mumbling aloud, “Tariffs stay… tariffs go… tariffs stay…” as he plucked each petal with extreme focus

“It’s been this way ever since he lost his Magic 8-Ball,” one anonymous aide confided. “Apparently, the 8-Ball kept saying ‘Reply hazy, try again,’ and he found that offensive. So now we’re trusting flower-based economic signals.”

Witnesses say Trump had been seated cross-legged on the lawn for nearly twenty minutes before anyone realized what he was doing, prompting one intern to ask, “Is he… meditating?” Only to be told, “No. He's tariffing.”

When an aide attempted to gently suggest the president consult an actual trade advisor, Trump reportedly waved him off, saying:

“Don’t rush me. I have a great method, a beautiful method, really. People always ask me: ‘How do you come up with these great tariffs?’ And I say, ‘Well, nature just speaks to me. It's always done that.’”

He then added, “Daisies don’t lie. That’s what the liberal economists don’t understand. Daisies are pro-America.”

Sources say Trump has also begun referring to the plant as “Secretary Petalstein.”

Officials at the Office of the United States Trade Representative are said to be “deeply concerned,” as the latest daisy-based decision led to the sudden reimplementation of a 25% tariff on imported bidets, followed minutes later by a total withdrawal from the same policy after Trump found another daisy “with better energy.”

“We just started ignoring the flower thing after a while,” said one senior official. “We’ve been working off the assumption that any economic plan can be reversed by a stiff breeze or a squirrel.”

The stock market briefly dipped after rumors spread that Trump had begun using dandelions, which he allegedly considers “the alpha male of weeds.”

Foreign leaders expressed a mix of confusion and exasperation at Trump’s new organic strategy.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney was reportedly speechless after being informed his country’s maple syrup industry is once again under review due to "suspicious floral vibes."

“President Trump believes in going with his gut, and sometimes his gut speaks through flowers. That’s just how greatness works," Said one Trump representative.

When asked whether the daisy-based strategy would extend to foreign policy or judicial appointments, Trump replied, “We’re not ruling out tulips.”

Sources claim Trump has already ordered a truckload of seasonal blooms delivered to Mar-a-Lago, including roses (“for NATO stuff”), carnations (“for IRS audits”), and a mysterious box labeled “Secret Ukrainian Chrysanthemums.”

He’s also reportedly been experimenting with fortune cookies, palm readings, and using “how hard the wind hits his hair” as a barometer for infrastructure spending.

Meanwhile, the daisies remain silent, swaying gently in the breeze. Perhaps the only sane participants left in the entire process.
