Sources at the White House report that president Donald Trump was spotted in the flower garden methodically picking petals off a daisy while mumbling, “Tariffs stay… tariffs go… tariffs stay…” Staff claim this has become his preferred trade policy method since he lost his Magic 8-Ball. At one point, an aide attempted to interrupt, prompting Trump to ramble, “Don’t rush me. I have a great method, a beautiful method really. People always ask ‘How do you come up with these great tariffs?’ And I say, ‘Well nature just speaks to me,’ and that’s the way it is.”
