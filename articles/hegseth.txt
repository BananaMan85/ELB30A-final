WASHINGTON, D.C. – United States secretary of defence Pete Hegseth unveiled his latest project this week: a mobile app called “OpDrop”, designed to bring Americans “closer than ever” to real-time U.S. military operations, classified or not. The app promises live updates on troop movements, drone flight paths, and “behind-the-scenes” footage from ongoing black ops. 

“Why send all this information to a journalist when we can cut out the middle-man and deliver it directly to Americans ourselves?” Hegseth stated confidently.

National security officials have voiced alarm, calling the app “deeply reckless” and “legally impossible.” Hegseth shrugged off the criticism, claiming the app is “protected under the First and Second Amendments. Probably both.”
