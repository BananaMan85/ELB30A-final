Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre was spotted standing in the back of the house of commons yesterday, allegedly attempting to “pass for a coat rack”. After losing his seat to Liberal MP Bruce Fanjoy in the recent federal election, Poilievre has been desperate to return to parliament with no luck until he devised a new plan. Poilievre had sneaked into the house of commons in the midst of a group of MPs and took his place near the back of the chambers. He appears to have opted for a strategy of standing so still that no one would notice his presence. Security only noticed him when, during a silent pause, he was heard coughing and muttering “Ax the tax,” and “My- uh… Poilievre’s idea first.”
