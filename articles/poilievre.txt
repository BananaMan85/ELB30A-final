OTTAWA – In a scene that left Members of Parliament confused, amused, and mildly concerned, former Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre was apprehended yesterday after allegedly sneaking into the House of Commons and attempting to pass as a coat rack.

The strange stunt comes just weeks after Poilievre lost his seat in a shocking electoral upset to Liberal MP Bruce Fanjoy. Since the defeat, sources close to Poilievre say he has been “exploring unconventional routes” back into public life, with yesterday’s attempt being his most literal yet.

“At first, I thought it was just a modern art installation,” said one confused NDP MP. “But then I heard it muttering something about taxes and realized: wait a minute, that’s Pierre!”

According to eyewitnesses, Poilievre arrived early in the morning, tailing a group of MPs as they entered the chamber. Dressed in a stiff beige trench coat and wearing a decorative hat rack strapped to his back, he positioned himself silently in a corner of the House, adopting what staff later described as “a deeply committed mannequin stance.”

“He was incredibly still,” said one Commons security officer. “I’ve seen coat racks with more natural sway.”

The ruse reportedly held for over an hour. He was only discovered during a moment of silence for a retiring parliamentary librarian was interrupted by a soft cough and a whisper of “Ax the tax… my—uh… Poilievre’s idea first…”

At that point, heads turned, and an alert page immediately called security, mistaking him for a malfunctioning animatronic from the Canadian Museum of History.

Sources within the Conservative Party have confirmed that this wasn’t Poilievre’s first attempt to bypass the rules of post-defeat obscurity.

“Last week, he tried to mail himself to Parliament in a box labeled ‘Private Caucus Snacks,’” said a staffer on condition of anonymity. “The man is determined. It’s... sort of admirable, in a deeply concerning way.”

Another source claims Poilievre has been spotted practicing impressions of sitting MPs, possibly preparing to sneak in under the guise of another MP, though no latex disguises have been officially confiscated.

Liberal MP Bruce Fanjoy, who now holds Poilievre’s former seat, addressed the incident with his trademark poise and a slight saxophone riff.

“I understand Mr. Poilievre misses the chamber, but we all need to accept democratic outcomes and the importance of coat rack integrity.”

Prime Minister Mark Carney declined to comment directly but could be heard chuckling in the hallways, saying only, “At least he wasn’t disguised as a chair this time.”

Security has updated its threat assessment protocols to include "furniture-based infiltration" and has increased surveillance on all hall trees, umbrella stands, and suspiciously motionless MPs.

Poilievre was reportedly escorted from the premises without incident, though he attempted to lodge a formal complaint by whispering it into a coat sleeve on his way out.

No charges have been laid, but insiders say he's already working on a return strategy involving a novelty-sized Canada Goose jacket and a pair of noise-cancelling earmuffs.

Until then, Commons officials are advising all parliamentarians to “shake their coat racks twice” before use.
