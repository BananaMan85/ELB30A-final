WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a bizarre yet somehow emotionally relatable moment during a press scrum today, Vice President J.D. Vance confessed that while he's “definitely sad” about the public and dramatic breakup between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, he’s also “kind of pumped” about the chance to celebrate two separate Christmases this year.

“Obviously, it’s tough not seeing them in the same room screaming at each other about tariffs and Mars colonization,” Vance told reporters while holding a crumpled copy of The Art of the Deal for Kids. “But they both said I’m still their little policy warrior, and honestly? I’m choosing to see the upside.”

Asked whether he was closer to Trump or Musk following the split, Vance diplomatically replied:

“They’re both great. Elon teaches me about techno-feudalism and orbital agriculture, and Trump gives me front-row seats to rallies where people throw hats at me. It’s really the best of both worlds.”

He paused, then added, “Plus, I already got confirmation that I’m getting a Hyperloop Playset and a solid-gold Ohio-shaped coin this year. That’s more than I got when they were together!”

The sudden end of the once-lavish Trump-Musk bromance has left political observers stunned and voters confused. Only months ago, the Elon made a post on X that he "loves [Donald Trump] as much as a straight man can love another man." (This part is real)

Now, with the schism official, both sides have reportedly unfollowed each other on Truth Social and X, and mutual allies are scrambling to choose loyalty or retreat to neutral bunkers.

As for Vance, he appears to be embracing his new role as the child of political divorce.

“I’ll be at Elon’s for Christmas Eve” he explained. “Then Christmas Day with President Trump at Mar-a-Lago. Lots of red meat, red ties, and re-gifted NFTs. I might even get a cabinet appointment as a stocking stuffer.”

White House insiders say Vance has been carefully tracking who gives the better gifts. Last year, Trump got him a signed copy the God Bless the U.S.A. Bible, while Musk sent him 17% of a cryptocurrency that no longer exists.

“They both try,” Vance shrugged. “Honestly, I just want them to be happy, and for me to get that 3D-printed Constitution set Elon promised.”

As legal experts debate who owns shared assets like “the phrase 'woke is broke'” and “the rights to defund the woke AI,” Vance is staying optimistic.

“The important thing is, even if they hate each other now, they love me. And that’s what matters. Well, that and campaign donations.”

Meanwhile, the rest of the government is bracing for awkward handoffs at think tank events, and the American public is left wondering whether they, too, can get double the political outrage under this new custody arrangement.
