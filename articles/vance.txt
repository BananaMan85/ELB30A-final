Vice President J.D. Vance told reporters today that while he’s “sad” about the sudden and very public falling-out between Donald Trump and Elon Musk, he’s also “kind of excited” about the possibility of getting two Christmases this year. “They both said I’m still their little policy warrior,” Vance said,“It’ll be different not seeing them in the same room yelling at each other about tariffs and Mars, but this way I get cash gifts from both.” The very public falling out between the president and Elon Musk has been a shock to the nation and a second chance at that present he wanted for one vice president.
