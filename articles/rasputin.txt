In a series of baffling events that has conspiracy theorists updating their cork boards, Elon Musk reportedly survived poisoning at a billionaire dinner and drove a Cybertruck into a lake and walked out an hour later. Eyewitnesses at the dinner claim Musk consumed “at least three possibly cursed oysters” before tweeting “Still here. Still vibing.” Later, he was seen emerging from a lake in a soaked Tesla t-shirt. Many historians are calling for Musk to be treated as a Rasputin-level threat.
