WASHINGTON, D.C. – In a bold pivot from his usual technocratic composure, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has adopted an unconventional strategy to address questions about the economic fallout from Trump-era tariffs: he simply points to a weathered “I Did That” sticker of former President Donald Trump, affixed just below the microphone at his press briefing podium.

The sticker, featuring Trump mid-point with a self-satisfied smirk, appears to have been peeled from a gas pump sometime in 2022. It was first spotted two weeks ago, during a Q&A with financial reporters, where Powell declined to verbally address a question about recent supply chain shocks and instead tapped the sticker twice and shrugged.

“It’s a visual aid,” Powell explained after the briefing. “Like a chart, but with more spray tan.”

According to insiders at the Federal Reserve, Powell installed the sticker himself late last month after what one staffer described as “a five-hour session of trying to explain to Bloomberg why monetary policy can’t fix international tomato prices.”

“He just snapped,” said a Fed speechwriter. “He looked at another graph of retaliatory tariffs and said, ‘Nope, I’m done. Bring me the sticker.’”

The sticker, now curling slightly at the edges, has become a permanent fixture. Powell reportedly keeps a drawer of backups in case it peels off mid-press conference. “We offered to make a laminated one,” the staffer added. “He refused. He says the peeling adds ‘texture.’”

At first, financial journalists assumed the sticker was a prank. But after Powell pointed to it for the seventh time in two briefings, and even once using a laser pointer for emphasis, the message became clear.

During one particularly tense moment, Powell was asked whether the Fed had contingency plans for further trade disruption with China. Without a word, he reached under the podium, produced a second sticker of Trump in a cowboy hat labeled “Mission Accomplished Again?”, and slapped it next to the first.

Former President Trump responded on Truth Social, writing:

“Jerome POWder jealous of me AGAIN!!! Sticker is FAKE NEWS!! I would never point like that, everyone knows I point STRONGER!!”

Meanwhile, Democrats appear torn. Some are praising Powell’s dry wit, while others are questioning whether the central bank chair should be expressing opinions at all, even in sticker form.

“I mean, it’s not wrong,” said Rep. Katie Porter. “But I would’ve gone with a chart.”

The sticker has already taken on a life of its own. Etsy shops have begun selling replicas labeled “As Seen at the Fed,” and several economics professors have begun using the image in their lectures on unintended fiscal consequences.

A limited-edition NFT of the sticker, created without Powell’s knowledge, has sold for $1,900 in cryptocurrency. The buyer insists it will be “the cornerstone of my Jerome Powell fan shrine.”
