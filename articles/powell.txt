Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has reportedly taken a new approach to handling tariff-related questions during press conferences: silently pointing to a worn, slightly peeling “I Did That” sticker of Donald Trump, placed just beneath the podium microphone. Sources at the Fed say Powell installed the sticker late last month, after growing tired of being asked to explain the economic fallout from policies he “didn’t sign, suggest, or spiritually endorse.” Reporters initially thought the sticker was a prank, but Powell has now pointed to it seven times across two press briefings. At one point, he tapped it twice and nodded solemnly. “It’s a visual aid,” Powell clarified, “Like a chart, but with more spray tan.”
